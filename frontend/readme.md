# Bharat FoodTrace - Frontend (Step 2)

This directory contains the complete Next.js frontend for the Bharat FoodTrace application. It provides a modern, responsive, and fully interactive user interface for all three user roles: Consumers, Manufacturers, and Logistics Partners.

## ðŸš€ **Project Setup and Execution**

Follow these steps precisely to get the frontend running.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Node.js and npm:** You must have Node.js (version 18.x or higher) and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Running Backend:** The FastAPI backend from **Step 1 must be running** on `http://localhost:8000`. The frontend will not function without it.

### **Step 1: Project Structure**

1.  Create a new folder for your frontend project, for example `bharat-foodtrace-frontend`.
2.  Inside this folder, create the directories and files exactly as provided in the subsequent file blocks. Pay close attention to the folder structure (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `lib`, `styles`).

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Once all the files are in place, open your terminal in the root of your new frontend project folder (`bharat-foodtrace-frontend`) and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
